## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools like Gemini. AI was instrumental in:
-   **Scaffolding Components:** Generating initial boilerplate for React components and hooks.
-   **Configuring Charts:** Creating the necessary props and configurations for the Recharts library.
-   **Styling with Tailwind:** Producing responsive layouts and utility class strings for styling components.
-   **Writing Utility Functions:** Generating helper functions for data formatting and mock data creation.

This AI-assisted workflow accelerated development by handling repetitive tasks, allowing for a greater focus on architecture, user experience, and component integration.
